## About

**Angry Animals** is a physics-based game inspired by *Angry Birds*, developed in **Godot 4 with C#**.  
It started as a learning project, but you can now play it yourself!
The premise is simple: Destroy all the *Cups*, with the **least amount of attempts possible**!

---

## Features

- Drag-and-release mechanics with physics-based projectiles.
- Score tracking per level with save/load support.
- Simple UI for attempts and game over screen.
- Signal-based event handling (animals, cups, levels).
- Clean and well-documented C# code.

---

## How to Play

- Drag the animal with the mouse.
- Release to launch it against the cups.
- Destroy all cups to complete the level.
- Your **score** is based on the number of attempts (the fewer, the better!).

---

## Technology used
- **Godot Engine 4.4.1**
- **C#**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Custom Signals/Events system**
