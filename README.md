**Angry Animals** is a physics-based game inspired by *Angry Birds*, developed in **Godot 4 with C#**.  
It started as a learning project, but you can now play it yourself!  
---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Drag-and-release mechanics with physics-based projectiles.
- Score tracking per level with save/load support.
- Simple UI for attempts and game over screen.
- Signal-based event handling (animals, cups, levels).
- Clean and well-documented C# code.

---

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- Drag the animal with the mouse (or finger on mobile).
- Release to launch it against the cups.
- Destroy all cups to complete the level.
- Your **score** is based on the number of attempts (the fewer, the better!).
